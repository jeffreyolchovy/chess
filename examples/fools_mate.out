Play chess by typing a command at the prompt.

Navigate the board by using the alphanumeric coordinates.
White pieces are located at the bottom of the board, black are up top.
White pieces are capitalized.
White goes first.
      
Available commands are:
      
  h, help               - display this message
  m, move <from> <to>   - move a piece from <from> to <to>, e.g. m d2 d4
  p, print              - redraw the board to the console
  q, quit               - exit the program

NOTE: Since players will primarily be moving pieces, typing 'm' or 'move' before piece coordinates is optional.
